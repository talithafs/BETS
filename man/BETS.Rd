\title{BETS: A package for obtaining and analysing thousands of Brazilian economic time series.}
\description{
The Brazilian Economic Time Series (BETS) package provides access and
information about the most important Brazilian economic time series.

These series are created by three influential centers: the Central Bank of 
Brazil (BCB), the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE) 
and the Brazilian Institute of Economics, from the Getulio Vargas Foundation
(FVG-IBRE). Currently, there are more than 30.000 available time series, most
of them free of charge. Besides providing access to this vast database, the
package allows the user to interact with data in an easy and friendly way. 

For instance, the user can search for a time series using keywords. In a near 
future, the authors will publish a series of R exercises to be solved with 
BETS and its statiscal/econometrical tools, therefore helping the user to 
understand the behavior of brazilian time series.
