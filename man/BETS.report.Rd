\title{Create dynamic reports with a full analysis of a set of time series}
\usage{
BETS.report(mode = "SARIMA", ts = 21864, parameters = NULL,
  report.file = NA, series.saveas = "none")
}
\arguments{
\item{mode}{A \code{character}.The type of the analysis. So far, only 'SARIMA' is available.}

\item{ts}{An \code{integer}, a \code{ts} object or a \code{list} of \code{integer}s and \code{ts} objects. Either the ID of the series in the BETS database or a time series object (any series, not just BETS's). If a \code{list} is provided, a report is generated for each series in this list, which can be mixed with IDs and time series objects.}

\item{parameters}{A \code{list}. The parameters of the report. See the 'details' section for more information.}

\item{report.file}{A \code{character}. A path and a name for the report file (an .html file). If there is more than one series, this name will be used as a prefix. If this parameter is not provided, the report will be saved inside the 'reports' folder, under the BETS installation directory.}

\item{series.saveas}{A \code{character}. The format of the file on which the series and the predictions should be written. Possible values are 'none' (default), 'sas', 'dta', 'spss', 'csv', 'csv2' . Is is saved under the same directory as the report file.}
}
\value{
One or more .html files (the reports) and, optionally, data files (series plus predictions).
}
\description{
Generate automatic reports with a complete analysis of a set of time series. For now, only a SARIMA analysis (Box & Jenkins approach) is possible. In a near future, a GRNN (General Regression Neural Network) analysis will be released. Soon after, Holt-Winters, GRNN, Multilayer Perceptron, Fuzzy Logic and Box-Cox analysis will become available.
